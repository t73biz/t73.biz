		Having been a freelancer for about 15 years now, through various sites like freelancer, elance, and rent-a-coder, the gamefield has changed significatly.
	</p>

	<p>
		There have been many changes to the work flow of projects through these different sites. The one thing that has remained constant for the last 10 years, has been the severe competition of other developers. Being a diamond in a landscape of other gems, (and some fake gems) is a difficult and gruelling task to grind through. It hasn't always that way though.

		In early 2000, I started doing freelance work and landed my first big gig within months of starting. It was for a local guy actually, developing a pizza delivery system for his business that would allow the drivers to make pizzas on the way to your house. Remember that this was before 4g even existed. The technical challenges of this project was great. After the project finished, I was convinced that this was what I wanted to do for my career. Freelance. Do a project, and move on. I was in for a rude awakening come 2004-2005.
	</p>

	<p>
		It was about this time that companies and startups started to discover the overseas developer markets more and more. At this time, I had a couple of dozen projects under my belt, and was very confidient in my skills. I had several repeat clients at the time. A few of them had gone over seas to have a small project done, and eventually came back in order to have it done the right way.
	</p>

	<p>
		As I grow in wisdom and knowledge, my time to me and my clients becomes more important as ever. The time that it takes for me to research a project, bid on it, follow up with a client, not to mention the fees that most freelance sites now charge, makes it difficult to do what I enjoy the most. Program. I just want to make beautiful things that most people won't even see, but the few that do will appreciate the value.
	</p>

	<p>
		Working for Toptal will give me this opportunity. I can focus on the "Git`r done!" parts of the project, and leave the other details to Toptal. I am certain that this will get me back to the good old days of programming, and less grinding on finding projects.

		I will follow up with another article about the interview process, should I get that far.
