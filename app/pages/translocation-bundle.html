	<h1>Symfony 2 Translocation Bundle  </h1>

	<p>No, it's not a typo. It's a melding of translation, locale, internationalization, and localization. <br />
	This package is meant to extend and enhance the capabilities of Symfony 2 Translation Service.</p>

	<p>A few areas of the Symfony2 Translate Service that seems to be lacking are:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>The ability to parse smarty templates</li>
		<li>The ability to use browser-accepts locale</li>
		<li>A Decent UI reporting for translation strings</li>
		<li>A flexible translation command</li>
	</ul>
