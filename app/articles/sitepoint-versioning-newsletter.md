	<h1>Sitepoint Versioning Newsletter</h1>
	<p>Recently I opted in to the Sitepoint.com Versioning Newsletter. In the handful of editions that I have recieved, I have found it to be a great resource.</p>

	<p>Versioning does for the web dev geek what the Wall Street Journal does for the investor geek. The articles and information that has been relayed so far has been a great way to keep a finger on the pulse of the internet. </p>

	<p>I find it to be factual, poigniant, and entertaining. The topics covered range from programming tips and ideas, to corporate information about the big (and sometimes not so big) companies that live in the land of net.</p>

	<p>If you'd like to find out more, visit <a href='http://www.sitepoint.com/introducing-versioning/'>http://www.sitepoint.com/introducing-versioning/</a> and signup today. Maybe I'm just a sucker.</p>

	<p>Let me know if you think I'm wrong or right.</p>
